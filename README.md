Functions as a Service (FaaS)
=============================

This repository contains all the work completed for COMP60020 Simulation and Modelling in Autumn 2022. It uses the SimPy library to simulate a FaaS model and analyze the results based on a set of given input data "trace-final.csv". The aim of this coursework was to investigate how the cold start ratio and loss rate varied as the memory capacity, M, of the system changed.
